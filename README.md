## Synopsis

Crowdify is a web app that generates playlists for Spotify. An organiser can create an event, which attendees can then click to attend by clicking a URL. We then aggregate the music preferences of all the attendees, and generate a playlist which matches the preferences of the attendees as closely as possible. When the organiser clicks the button on the event page, this playlist is generated in their spotify account.


## Motivation

Whether at parties, conferences, or meetings, we often need to generate music that a large group of people will like. We'd prefer to be able to do this without explicitly requiring the user to specify songs (as we can do in a collaborative playlist, for instance), instead automatically fetching the user's song preferences which already exist in their Spotify account.	

## Privacy Policy
We don't store any personally identifying information from guests who add their preferences to a playlist. We only store a list of the 50 top songs from each (anonymised) user.
